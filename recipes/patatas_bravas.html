    </ul>

    <ul><b>Spice blend:</b>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoong round chipotle pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><b>Potatoes:</b>
        <li>2 quarts cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dipping sauce: Combine garlic, smoked paprika, and salt in a mortar and pestle or food processor; process until smooth. Mix in mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, tomato paste, chipotle chile powder, and cayenne pepper until combined. Cover and refrigerate sauce.</li>
        <li>Make spice blend: Mix together salt, black pepper, paprika, and chipotle chile powder in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make potatoes: Pour water into a large saucepan. Stir salt, smoked paprika, cumin, and bay leaves into water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover; simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir potatoes into seasoned water, bring to a boil, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not fully cooked, 4 to 5 minutes. The tip of a paring knife should easily insert into the center of a potato cube. Drain potatoes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Add cooled potato cubes and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to cool slightly. Toss in a bowl with spice blend and serve with dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
